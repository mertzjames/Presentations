# Cybersecurity and Python

## Title suggestions:

* Protected Python: It's time we had 'the talk'
* Secure Python: How to protect yourself and users from common attacks

## Elevator Pitch

Today, developers and users of Python are being attacked on a daily basis, most of the
time, without their knowledge.  We need to be more aware of these attacks and weaknesses
to make more educated design decisions for our Python code.

## Description

Today, developers and users of Python are being attacked on a daily basis, most of the
time, without their knowledge.  We need to be more aware of these attacks and weaknesses
to make more educated design decisions for our Python code.

In this talk we'll go over some of the major vulnerabilities they face when it comes to
developing Python application and cybersecurity principles.  We'll also cover different
ways to protect yourself from these attacks.

## Notes

I work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Software Assurance Engineer where I work
with a team of other engineers in identifying and assuring different aspects of
cybersecurity practices and principles.

If the suggested title is too sensitive then this is an alternative:

Secure Python: How to protect yourself and users from common attacks
